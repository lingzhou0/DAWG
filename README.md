# Applied Math Working Group

Welcome to the Applied Math Working Group at Duke University. All graduate students, postdocs, and faculty are welcome! 

**Meeting Time:** Tuesdays, 10-11am  
**Location:** Gross Hall 324  

## About the Seminar

The primary function of this group/seminar is akin to a journal club, to learn topics of interest together, versus a more traditional seminar speaker series. 

## Sessions

- **March 5th: Organizational Meeting**

  We introduced ourselves, discussed the structure and goals of the group, and selected topics for the rest of the semester. The current common interest of the group is the intersection of:
  - Application
  - Multiparameter persistence
  - Machine learning
  - Data
  - Software

- **March 26th: Introduction to Topological Data Analysis (TDA) and Giotto**  
  Ranthony prepared the following notebook to walk through the basics of TDA and Giotto:

- **April 2nd:** [Details Pending / To Be Announced]
  [Giotto_TDA_Week_2_lorenz_attractor.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1cq-JWfxScdnuFl37MY2fI3kucBPlKd7N?usp=sharing)

- **April 9nd:** [Tentative: review Giotto-TDA tutorials (1) classifying_shapes.ipynb; (2) MNIST_classification.ipynb]
